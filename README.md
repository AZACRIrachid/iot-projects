Clone this repository

## Step 2
After cloning this repository, you will create a folder `team-name` where you will write a `team-name.md` MARKDOWN file (`team-name` being the name of your team).
Your file must contain the following PRELIMINARY components:
* Members of your team (name, email, github profile);
* Name of your IoT product;
* A description of your IoT product (A problematic you are targeting, your solution, market you are targeting, etc.). **A paragraph of about 200 words should be fine**;
* A preliminary list of components that you think appropriate;
* [Optional] Any document that you find related to your project. These have to be put under a folder `team-name/resources/`;

This first step is very important and require, from you, a little work of research. Try to get inspired by what is done currently in the market (FabLabs, CES 2019, etc.).
